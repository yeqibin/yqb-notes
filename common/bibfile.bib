  abstract = {An experimental study is described on the fracture toughness and micro-mechanisms associated with the initiation and propagation of cracks in metallic nickel containing marked gradients in grain size, ranging from {$\sim$}30 nm to {$\sim$}4 {$\mu$}m. Specifically, cracks are grown in a gradient structured (GS) nickel with grain-size gradient ranging from the coarse macro-scale to nano-scale (CG \textrightarrow{} NG) and vice versa (NG \textrightarrow{} CG), with the measured crack-resistance R-curves compared to the corresponding behavior in uniform nano-grained (NG) and coarse-grained (CG) materials. It is found that the gradient structures display a much-improved combination of high strength and toughness compared to uniform grain-sized materials. However, based on J-integral measurements in the gradient materials, the crack-initiation toughness is far higher for cracks grown in the direction of the coarse-to-nano grained gradient than vice versa, a result which we ascribe primarily to excessive crack-tip blunting in the coarse-grained microstructure. Both gradient structures, however, display marked rising R-curve behavior with exceptional crack-growth toughnesses exceeding 200 MPa.m\textonehalf.},

  abstract = {An anti-embrittlement roadmap
Hydrogen is important for energy applications such as fuel cells but tends to diffuse into materials and make them more susceptible to fracture. Chen et al. tackled the challenge of identifying the exact location of hydrogen atoms in two common steels. The light weight and high mobility of hydrogen creates serious problems with conventional techniques. The authors used cryo-transfer atom probe tomography to show that hydrogen is pinned to various interfaces in the steels. This direct look into hydrogen trapping should help with the development of materials that are more resistant to hydrogen embrittlement.
Science, this issue p. 171
Hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steel is an obstacle for using these steels in sustainable energy production. Hydrogen embrittlement involves hydrogen-defect interactions at multiple-length scales. However, the challenge of measuring the precise location of hydrogen atoms limits our understanding. Thermal desorption spectroscopy can identify hydrogen retention or trapping, but data cannot be easily linked to the relative contributions of different microstructural features. We used cryo-transfer atom probe tomography to observe hydrogen at specific microstructural features in steels. Direct observation of hydrogen at carbon-rich dislocations and grain boundaries provides validation for embrittlement models. Hydrogen observed at an incoherent interface between niobium carbides and the surrounding steel provides direct evidence that these incoherent boundaries can act as trapping sites. This information is vital for designing embrittlement-resistant steels.
Cryogenic atom probe observations map hydrogen to a variety of interfaces, providing insight into hydrogen embrittlement.

  abstract = {Significant volume of literatures are already available in the published domain reporting the mechanical and fracture behaviour of different pressure vessel steels under various testing conditions and other potential circumstances. There have been limited researches available in the open domain to correlate the tensile properties of these steels with their corresponding fracture features at various testing temperatures, which are primarily aimed at in the current investigation. A comprehensive literature review has been performed to realise this fact critically. There has been high probability that fracture features are the signature of the entire deformation history which was operated in the material. In order to understand this hypothesis, many tensile experiments are carried out at a constant strain rate by systematic variation in temperature of a reactor pressure vessel steel. The initial inclusion content and their distribution pattern are kept unaltered for all the specimens before tests, and temperatures are varied methodically to vary the nucleation sites of micro-voids (i.e. carbides, phase interfaces, etc.) which result in change of ductile fracture features. Conventional metallographic technique has been employed to characterise the microstructures at various temperatures. Fractographic characterisation of all broken tensile specimens is done to measure the two-dimensional fracture features (i.e. dimple geometry, extent of tearing ridge pattern and dimple number density) under secondary mode of imaging in scanning electron microscope. Quantitative fractography and image processing have been extensively employed to measure the two-dimensional fractographic features. An excellent correlation has been drawn between the ductile fractographic features, microstructures and corresponding tensile properties of the material as a function of test temperature. This study brings to the fore that from the systematic fractographic features, it is possible to determine reasonably the mechanical and fracture properties of a material, when the microstructure is known.},

This may be attributed to the differences in compositions, heat treatment, drawing conditions, the methodology applied for measuring microstructural entities and inaccuracy in measurements. Currently, a neural network model is created to correlate the complex relationship between tensile ductility with its influencing parameters in a variety of cold drawn pearlitic steels. The model has been applied to confirm that the calculations are reasonable in the context of metallurgical theories and other data published in the literature.},

  abstract = {A new thermomechanical processing route is described for a microalloyed steel, with roughing deformation below the recrystallisation-stop temperature (T5\%), followed by a rapid reheat to 1200~\textdegree{}C for 10s, and then finish deformation at the same temperature as the rough deformation. The new route focused on optimising the kinetics of strain-induced precipitation (SIP) and the formation of deformation-induced ferrite transformation (DITF). For comparative purposes, two experimental 0.06~wt\% C steels were studied: one with 0.03~wt\% Nb (Nb steel), and a second with both 0.03~wt\% Nb and 0.02~wt\% Ti (NbTi steel). Two processing routes were studied. The first was a conventional route, which consisted of a simulated rough deformation schedule with the final roughing pass taking place at 850~\textdegree{}C, which produced fully unrecrystallised austenite grains during deformation with no strain-induced ferrite formation. The second, new, thermomechanical processing route used the same roughing step, after which the steels were reheated at 10~\textdegree{}C/s to a temperature of 1200~\textdegree{}C, isothermally held for 10s allowing for precipitate dissolution, prior to air cooling to a finishing deformation temperature of 850~\textdegree{}C. This route resulted in DIFT primarily on the prior-austenite grain boundaries. The precipitate solution during the reheat treatment increased the supersaturation of Nb and Ti in the austenite matrix on subsequent cooling, which therefore increased the undercooling due to the increased Ae3. The observation of nanoscale cementite in the DIFT supports the view that it formed through a massive transformation mechanism. The volume fraction of SIP after finish deformation was influenced by the supersaturation of microalloy elements in solution during heat treatment. The new process route led to a significant refinement of the final ferrite grain size.},

After multi-pass rolling and intermittent annealing at 550\,\textdegree{}C for 300\,s, the obtained UFG-1 steel showed an average ferrite grain size of \textasciitilde{}430\,nm, containing nanoscale spheroidized cementite (Fe3C) particles with an average size of \textasciitilde{}70\,nm. On annealing at 600\,\textdegree{}C for 300\,s, the average size of ferritic grains was increased to \textasciitilde{}680\,nm and the average size of spheroidized Fe3C particles increased to \textasciitilde{}90\,nm, referred as UFG-2 steel. Tensile tests indicated that UFG-1 steel had high yield strength ({$\sigma$}
                        y) of 1260\,MPa, and ultimate tensile strength ({$\sigma$}
                        UTS) of 1400\,MPa. These values are higher than that of UFG-2 steel ({$\sigma$}

The incoherent interfaces between nanosized particles and the matrix acted as a strong barrier to dislocation motion. The study underscores that nanosized precipitates not only provide strength but also contribute to ductility, which is very encouraging for improving the ductility of medium-carbon steels.},

  abstract = {Composition analysis of carbide and carbo-nitride precipitates was performed for two Nb-Ti microalloyed steels with yield strengths of 750 and 580 MPa using an atom probe study. In the high-Ti 750 MPa steel, Ti-rich (Ti,Nb)(C,N) and Ti-rich (Ti,Nb)(C) precipitates were observed. In the high-Nb 580 MPa steel, a Ti-rich (Ti,Nb)(C,N) precipitate and (Ti,Nb)(C) clusters were noted. These (Ti,Nb)(C) clusters in the high-Nb 580 MPa steel were smaller than the (Ti,Nb)(C) precipitates in high-Ti 750 MPa steel. In general, a larger number of precipitates were found in the high-Ti 750 MPa steel. This difference in the number density of the precipitates between the two steels is attributed to the difference in Ti content. Combining the atom probe tomography results and thermodynamic calculations, the precipitation sequence in these alloys was inferred to be the following: as the temperature decreases, TiN precipitates out of the solution with successive (Ti,Nb)(C,N) layers of varying composition forming on these Ti-rich precipitates. Once N is depleted from the solution, a second set of (Ti,Nb)(C) precipitates in a similar manner in the matrix and also onto the carbo-nitride phase. This observation is consistent with previous observations in high-strength low-alloy steels containing comparable amounts of only Nb. It was noted that the amount of Nb, Nb/(Nb + Ti), in the precipitates decreased from 0.20 to 0.04 with the size of the precipitate. We believe that this is due to the Nb supersaturation in the matrix when these precipitates nucleate.},

  abstract = {The Asian projects are now in their second terms after the five year first terms. Ultrafine grained steels were developed in lab scale and/or in a practical process. A basic approach has been performed to explore the evolution mechanisms of ultrafine grained microstructures. Two approaches have been investigated to make the ultrafine grains: the ``recrystallization route'' and the transformation route. In the ``recrystallization'' route, heavy deformation at low temperature is necessary for the ultrarefinement. In the transformation route making the high density of ferrite initiation sites in the deformed austenite, especially of the heavily compressed austenite structures, is essential for the ultra-refinement and further hindering the ferrite growth is also inevitable to utilize the high initiation rate. Strength and toughness are dramatically improved by the ultra-refinement. Fatigue property is also excellent. The poor uniform elongation can be enhanced by the design of the second phase dispersion. At the same time, the application has also been pursued from various viewpoints of engineering to take advantage of the ultrafine grained steels. Bridge, ship, construction, automobile and other high strength parts are being attempted for application.Les projets asiatiques sont maintenant dans leur second terme apr{\`e}s le premier terme de cinq ans.

The alloys have good properties, but the scatter in properties is of prime interest in safe design. Such scatter can arise from microstructural variations but most studies conclude that large components made from such steels are, following heat treatment, fully bainitic. In the present work, we demonstrate with the help of a variety of experimental techniques that the microstructures of three SA508 Gr.3 alloys are far from homogeneous when considered in the context of the cooling rates encountered in practice. In particular, allotriomorphic ferrite that is expected to lead to a deterioration in toughness, is found in the microstructure for realistic combinations of austenite grain size and the cooling rate combination. Parameters are established to identify the domains in which SA508 Gr.3 steels transform only into the fine bainitic microstructures.},

Dynamic ferrite transformation occurs in a diffusional manner, whose partitioning behavior changes from para- to ortho-equilibrium with the progress of transformation. Moreover, we propose that dynamic recrystallization of dynamically-transformed ferrite is the main mechanism for the formation of ultrafine-grained structure.},

  abstract = {Ultrafine grained steels with grain sizes below about 1 {$\mu$}m offer the prospect of high strength and high toughness with traditional steel compositions. These materials are currently the subject of extensive research efforts worldwide. Ultrafine grained steels can be produced either by advanced thermomechanical processes or by severe plastic deformation strategies. Both approaches are suited to produce submicron grain structures with attractive mechanical properties. This overview describes the various techniques to fabricate ultrafine grained bcc steels, the corresponding microstructures, and the resulting spectrum of mechanical properties.},

  abstract = {Ultrafine grained (UFG) steels with grain sizes around 1 micron exhibit an excellent strength-ductility combination and have been extensively studied worldwide. Among the different grain refinement strategies, thermomechanical controlled processing (TMCP) employing dynamic transformation (DT), that is, ferrite transformation during deformation of austenite, is considered as the simplest and commercially exploitable approach to produce ultrafine ferrite (UFF) with grain size of a couple of microns or below. The present paper reviews the research history of DT and highlights the major aspects of continuous interest including the methods and evidences for identifying DT, thermodynamics and kinetics of DT, mechanism for UFF formation and the effects of some key thermomechanical parameters on DT (and UFF formation), together with an outlook for the future research, and new TMCP design for industrial application. This paper also discusses some areas remaining under debate such as the diffusional or displacive mechanism, thermodynamic modeling, and the mechanism for UFF formation, etc.},
