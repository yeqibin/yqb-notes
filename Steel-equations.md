# A collection of equations for steel

Hall-Petch relationship:
$$
\sigma_{y}=\sigma_{0}+k_{y} \cdot d^{-1 / 2}
$$
The ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) is defined as the temperature for 50% cleavage on the fracture surfaces of the Charpy impact samples.
$$
\mathrm{DBTT}=A-k^{\prime} \cdot d^{-1 / 2}
$$
